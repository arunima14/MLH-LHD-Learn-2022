<h2># Hand-Gestures</h2>
It prints the hand gestures shown.

<br>
<h3>How does it exactly work?</h3>
ðŸ‘‰ Adjusting the brightness of screen varies result.<br>
ðŸ‘‰ try to position hand completely in the box and avoid arm or wrist coming in the box(as it will change the area ratio).<br>
ðŸ‘‰ done using range values so may work for different color ranges for different people.<br>
